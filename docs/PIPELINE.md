# Pipeline Plan: phone → train → view

Status: in-progress. Living document — keep it short, edit as we learn.

## North star

```
phone video ──▶ COLMAP ──▶ blade-volume-train ──▶ PointCloudModel ──▶ blade-volume-view
                              (meganeura)
```

The library boundary is `PointCloudModel` (or a PowerFoam-extended version of it). The
viewer doesn't know how the model was produced; the trainer doesn't know how it gets
rendered. Both link `blade-volume` for shared types and shaders.

## Non-goals

- No Python, no PyTorch, no Burn.
- No new representations beyond what we render. The trainer optimises one of:
  Gaussian (current), RadFoam (current), or PowerFoam (M2). We will not invent a new one.
- No on-device capture code initially — phone capture stays manual (record + transfer).
  We'll automate that later if and only if the rest of the pipeline is solid.

## Milestones

Each milestone is sized to fit in a handful of focused sessions and lands behind passing
`cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings` and `cargo test --workspace`.

### M1 — Shader modularisation (foundation)

Today the test harness re-implements `// #include` for WGSL (`radfoam_gpu_vs_cpu.rs`).
Promote it to the library so M2 and M3 don't have to duplicate it.

- Move the `preprocess_shader` helper into `blade-volume/src/shaders.rs`.
- Expose a `compose(entry)` returning a fully-expanded WGSL string.
- Have `gpu/{gaussian,radfoam}.rs` and `blade-volume-view` use it.
- Tests: keep the existing GPU-vs-CPU test working unchanged.

Risk: low. Pure refactor.

### M2 — PowerFoam adoption

Power Foam = weighted Voronoi (power diagram) instead of plain Voronoi. Per-site weight,
radical-plane faces, Čech-complex adjacency. The PowerFoam paper bundles a much richer
appearance model (per-cell quaternion + texel sites + spherical-Voronoi colours); we
defer all of that and reuse our SH path. Adoption order:

#### M2a — `radius` in `PointCloudModel`

- Add `pub radii: Option<Vec<f32>>` to `PointCloudModel`.
- Round-trip through the RadFoam PLY reader/writer: optional `radius` float property.
- No shader changes yet — render code ignores the radii.
- Tests: extend the PLY round-trip test with a radii-present case.

#### M2b — Čech-complex adjacency builder (done)

- `adjacency::compute_cech(points, radii, config)` emits an edge `{i,j}` when
  `|p_i - p_j| ≤ r_i + r_j`; returns the existing CSR `Adjacency`.
- Candidates are pruned with a `kiddo` k-d tree range query (radius
  `r_i + r_max`), then the exact overlap predicate filters them.
- `PointCloudModel::compute_adjacency_default` dispatches: Čech when
  `radii.is_some()`, Delaunay otherwise.
- `kiddo` promoted from dev-dep to runtime dep on `blade-volume`.

#### M2c — Power Foam WGSL (done)

Implementation deviates from the original plan in one way: rather than fork a new
shader / backend, we extend the existing `radfoam_trace.wgsl` to take a
`rf_get_radius` accessor and use the radical-plane formula

```
shift       = 0.5 + 0.5 * (r_i² - r_j²) / |p_j - p_i|²
face_origin = p_i + shift * (p_j - p_i)
face_normal = p_j - p_i
```

When radii are zero the shift collapses to `0.5` and the plane is the standard
Voronoi bisector — so unweighted clouds traverse identically to before.

To avoid adding a bind-group entry, the per-point radius lives in the otherwise-
unused `.w` channel of `g_points`. `gpu/radfoam.rs` writes
`model.radii.as_deref().map_or(0.0, |r| r[i])` into that slot at upload.
Both shader includers (`radfoam.wgsl` single-object, `scene_traverse.wgsl`
multi-object) gained a one-line `rf_get_radius` accessor.

Viewer auto-selection: no change needed — `RadFoamBackend` now handles both
weighted and unweighted models. `radii.is_some()` produces Power Foam traversal
automatically.

#### M2d — Cross-check (done, self-consistency)

External cross-check against a PowerFoam checkpoint is parked: it needs a CUDA-
trained scene we don't have. Instead we proved internal consistency:

- `radfoam_cpu_ref.rs` (CPU reference tracer) now uses the same radical-plane
  formula as `radfoam_trace.wgsl`. A `read_radius` helper returns 0 when
  `model.radii` is `None`, so unweighted clouds still trace as before.
- New `powerfoam_gpu_matches_cpu_with_radii` test runs the same fixture as the
  plain RadFoam regression but with asymmetric per-point radii (spine 0.015,
  branches 0.030) — the radical plane shifts noticeably away from the bisector,
  so any mismatch between WGSL and CPU formulas would surface here. Both
  tracers match within f16 precision.
- The original `radfoam_gpu_matches_cpu_on_tiny_fixture_for_some_pixels`
  regression and the new radii test now share a `assert_gpu_matches_cpu(...)`
  helper.

When a real PowerFoam scene shows up, the path forward is a Python script in
`etc/` that reads PowerFoam's `model.pt` and emits our radii-extended PLY —
deferred until that data exists.

### M3 — Training crate scaffolding

New crate: `blade-volume-train`. Depends on `blade-volume` + `meganeura`. Never the
reverse.

#### M3a — Crate skeleton

- `cargo new --lib blade-volume-train`, wire into workspace.
- Define the trainer state: parameters mirror `PointCloudModel` fields but live as
  meganeura tensors with gradients.
- Conversion: `TrainerState ⇆ PointCloudModel`.

#### M3b — COLMAP loader

- Read `sparse/0/{cameras,images,points3D}.bin`. Pure Rust, no native deps.
- Camera intrinsics + extrinsics → our `CameraParams` type.
- Initial sparse points → starting `PointCloudModel`.
- Tests: parse a small COLMAP dump we keep under `etc/` (git-LFS or generated in a
  doc-test).

#### M3c — Differentiable forward + loss

- The renderer is currently GPU compute. We need either:
  (a) a CPU reference forward that's differentiable through meganeura, or
  (b) a GPU forward + custom backward.
- Start with (a) at low resolution to debug the math, then move to (b) for speed.
- Loss: L1 + SSIM over rendered vs. ground-truth images.
- Optimiser: Adam from meganeura.

#### M3d — Online viewer attach

- During training, periodically convert `TrainerState → PointCloudModel` and hand it
  to a running `blade-volume-view` instance via a shared `Arc<Mutex<...>>`.
- This mirrors PowerFoam's `--viewer` flag.

### M4 — Capture stage

Only after M3 produces something worth looking at.

- A short doc page: which phone apps work, what frame rate / exposure settings.
- `etc/colmap.sh` wrapper: video → frames → COLMAP sparse reconstruction.

## Sequencing recommendation

```
M1 ──▶ M2a ──▶ M2b ──▶ M2c ──▶ M2d
         │
         └─▶ M3a ──▶ M3b ──▶ M3c ──▶ M3d ──▶ M4
```

`M3a..M3d` can run in parallel with `M2b..M2d` because M3 only needs the
`PointCloudModel` shape from M2a, not the new renderer.

## Decisions parking lot

- Čech-complex builder: roll our own AABB tree, or pull `rstar`? Decide at M2b.
- meganeura API: tensors-of-vec3 or flat tensor-of-f32? Decide at M3a after reading
  meganeura's actual surface.
- Loss-domain (linear vs. sRGB) and tonemap: punt to M3c.

## Out-of-scope (for now)

- Texel/spherical-Voronoi appearance model from PowerFoam (M2 keeps SH).
- Mobile capture app.
- Multi-GPU / distributed training.
- LOD or streaming for huge scenes.
