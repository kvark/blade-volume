# Gaussian reconstruction plan

Status: active. This plan narrows the reconstruction work to the user's current
goal: posed images in; a cloud of Gaussian surface particles, PBR materials,
and lighting out; relit novel views measured against known truth.

## Constraints

- Runtime geometry stays a point cloud. Polygonal assets may be used by Blade
  to generate synthetic truth, but no polygonal representation enters the
  reconstructed asset or renderer.
- Rust and WGSL only. Blade supplies synthetic PBR radiance and G-buffer truth;
  Meganeura remains the differentiable training backend.
- Keep durable geometry at the `PointCloudModel` boundary. The current
  relightable surface model is an experimental staging format; once its
  Gaussian contract is measured, move the surviving geometry and material
  fields into the shared model rather than creating another parallel engine.
- Every quality claim includes held-out poses, coverage, and worst-view PSNR.
  Training-view error alone is not evidence.
- Heavy runs use `etc/cgroup_run.sh` with memory and GPU telemetry.

## A. Establish Gaussian surface semantics

1. Persist the particle kernel in `.surfel`/`.rply` without invalidating old
   files. Old flag-zero files remain compact-kernel controls.
2. Implement a finite isotropic surface Gaussian in CPU and WGSL. A stored
   radius is three standard deviations and is also the acceleration support.
3. Make foam reconstruction emit Gaussian particles by default, with an
   explicit compact-kernel ablation.
4. Cross-check CPU and physical-GPU pixels, then sweep support on Bonsai and
   Room at identical geometry/material budgets.

Current result (2026-08-02): implemented. At the selected 1.7-cell support and
unchanged particle counts, Gaussian versus compact improves held-out sRGB PSNR
from 14.07 to 14.50 dB on Bonsai and 14.17 to 14.37 dB on Room. Covered-region
PSNR improves by 0.92 and 0.50 dB respectively. The support sweep from 1.4 to
2.6 selects 1.7 across both scenes; broader kernels regain coverage but blur
appearance and reduce PSNR.

## B. Make Blade truth reproducible

1. Port the `relight_data` harness from Blade's research branch to the current
   Blade API and keep a small ignored smoke configuration.
2. Generate deterministic direct-lighting data first: several poses, known
   intrinsics, one known training environment, one held-out relighting
   environment, and linear radiance plus depth/normal/material truth.
3. Store only the generator and a manifest schema in Git. Generated planes,
   images, and benchmark outputs stay under `target/audit-runs`.

Current result (2026-08-02): the harness is ported onto Blade's exact revision
pinned by this workspace and pushed as Blade branch
`reconstruction-relight-data`. The port exposed and includes the missing
environment-map lifetime fix: assigning a real map used to destroy its prepare
pipeline and jump through an invalid driver handle. Its GPU regression passes,
and the 4-view smoke fixture is bit-for-bit identical to the research-branch
output. The full direct-light fixture is 8 poses, 5 environments, 200x150 and
128 paths; generated data remains under `target/audit-runs`.

## C. Close the synthetic upper bound

1. Fuse depth/normal truth from training poses into Gaussian surface particles.
   This deliberately hands geometry to the first material/light experiment so
   representation error is measured apart from image-only geometry error.
2. With the training environment known, fit diffuse albedo first; then enable
   roughness and F0 only where multiple view directions provide lobe evidence.
3. Render held-out poses under both the training light and an unseen light.
   Report geometry coverage, normal/material error, whole-frame and covered
   PSNR, and the exact truth-renderer ceiling.
4. Replace truth materials, then truth normals, one at a time. Do not proceed
   to harder geometry while a simpler stage is below its measured ceiling for
   unexplained reasons.

Current result (2026-08-02): the first upper bound is implemented by
`synthetic_reconstruct`. Six selected training cameras contribute 99,881
foreground G-buffer samples; held-out cameras 1 and 5 are not loaded by fusion.
At a 0.08 voxel and 1.7-cell support they produce 28,835 Gaussian particles,
whose 56.4% held-out coverage is within 0.3 percentage points of truth. A
single known `sun-east` light fits the material, and unseen `studio` lighting
at the two unseen poses scores 26.57 dB (worst 25.79). Truth materials on the
identical geometry score 27.33 dB, leaving a measured 0.76 dB material gap.
The compact-kernel control reaches 26.06 dB, while 16 sampled visibility rays
fall to 25.06 dB and cost roughly 35x more per frame.

The fitted parameters are deterministically clustered into 64 shared PBR
materials. This reduces the asset from 1.85 MB to 0.92 MB while changing the
held-out score by only 0.01 dB. Parallel roughness-level prefiltering reduces
the two-light setup from 3.70 s to 0.64 s with identical scores. The latest
artifact is
`target/audit-runs/synthetic-reconstruct-final-v3/scene.rply`, SHA-256
`a4ec939a45d6ab5bdef3f774dcb3d81a375ac7130e04a72b722dacf16c54e886`.

The depth-only upper bound estimates each particle normal by
centroided local covariance over the fused positions and resolves its sign from
the cameras that actually contributed that particle. Seven neighbours give
1.97-degree normal RMSE. The fitted held-out relight score is 26.45 dB versus
26.57 dB with truth normals; the matched material oracle is 27.18 versus 27.33
dB. This closes the normal-truth ablation to 0.12--0.15 dB without adding any
polygonal geometry. `--truth-normals` retains the old control. Section D
performs the next honest ablation by replacing truth depth with the
image-trained foam surface.

## D. Remove truth geometry

1. Initialize from the existing image-trained foam's multi-view depth surface;
   convert each oriented particle to Gaussian center, normal/covariance,
   support, and opacity without a polygonal intermediate.
2. Optimize center offsets, tangent scale, normal/covariance, and opacity
   against all training photographs. Re-record visibility after geometry moves;
   stale hit assignments are not a valid gradient.
3. Densify only from measured residual and geometric support. Prune particles
   that remain unsupported or transparent. Keep held-out poses out of fusion,
   visibility, fitting, and topology decisions.
4. Move the validated Gaussian PBR fields into `PointCloudModel`, add a native
   checkpoint with optimizer state, and make the viewer consume that model
   directly.

Current result (2026-08-02): `synthetic_foam` is the first end-to-end image-side
gate. It initializes 2,048 RadFoam sites from cameras alone and trains them from
six views of RGB plus foreground alpha; G-buffer positions and normals are read
only after training for diagnostics. Cameras 1 and 5 are excluded from
training, surface fusion, refinement, observations, and material fitting.

Aligning the deliberately sparse outer lattice layer with the mean camera side
raises held-pose radiance from the 20.13 dB world-axis baseline to 24.17 dB
(23.72 worst) without increasing the site budget. The trained foam yields 2,152
Gaussian surface particles, 53.3% held-pose coverage, and 18.31 dB under the
unseen light (17.94 worst). A second independent training run reaches 24.27 dB
radiance and 18.38 dB relighting, so the result is not a selected lucky
checkpoint.

The 2026-08-03 rerun keeps the conservative 256-cell path cap and removes
contention from its exact-zero padded gradients in Meganeura. Full training
falls from 65.60 to 29.51 seconds, while held-pose radiance remains 24.18 dB
and unseen-light relighting reaches 18.56 dB (18.30 worst). It extracts 2,167
Gaussian particles at 53.9% coverage with 0.6201 position RMSE. The latest
baseline artifacts are `target/audit-runs/synthetic-foam-zero-scatter-v1/model.ply`
(SHA-256 `90e32fe1ed1bf6021204f8d9a3e8aa3bd7e2dd381adaf618b48e0e4a007f8374`)
and `scene.rply`
(SHA-256 `38221090e2f45f94bf8122015a8e2d195a5224f9d062b10b10e1ef66ffc198da`).

The selected graph-packing rerun keeps every checkpoint parameter and the
256-step path cap, but gathers the degree-2 RGB SH coefficients as one wide
table. Three full repeats train in 16.00--16.05 seconds and reach 24.09--24.20 dB
held-pose radiance, 0.624--0.627 position RMSE, and 18.39--18.65 dB under the
unseen light. The latest selected reconstruction, including the follow-up path
mask cleanup, is
`target/audit-runs/mask-elision-v1/model.ply` (SHA-256
`700e645c9aa2b34e91d655cf941b9c9729c10ed68c2fff6bd2959daa536b8fea`); its
Gaussian PBR surface is `scene.rply` beside it (SHA-256
`47e7342a37ba09096d9a4d4254fa7a08e1c18da9d28569206f3af387b0b2797c`).

Higher camera-lattice position rates were not selected. A 0.08 ratio with a
300-step warmup improves the first three repeats to 25.52--25.85 dB on held
poses and 18.60--18.74 dB under the unseen light, but a fourth falls to 22.53
dB on the worst held pose. One repeat also has 12.58 world-unit training-depth
RMSE. Tiny atomic-order differences are being amplified by discrete topology;
neither more frequent rebuilds, a longer warmup, nor stronger quantile loss
stabilizes it. A matched Bonsai continuation also loses 0.40 dB over all 37
held views. The temporary warmup implementation is removed and both training
paths retain their previous position-rate defaults.

This is progress, not completion. The selected surface still has 0.620
world-unit position RMSE and 66.42-degree normal RMSE. Specular fitting is therefore
disabled for this gate: with two shared materials it can mistake a noisy
cluster for a perfect mirror and move held-light quality from 18.50 to 14.70
dB across otherwise similar runs. The fixed rough-dielectric fit is stable
within 0.07 dB and is about 5.8x faster. The next geometry milestone is a
differentiable shared Gaussian surface objective with refreshed visibility,
followed by normal/covariance optimization. Specular parameters stay gated until the
normal error and multi-light control show that they are identifiable.

## E. Performance and production gates

1. Profile separately: depth extraction, fusion/refinement, observation,
   material/light fitting, acceleration build, and per-view rendering.
2. Reuse scene acceleration and prefiltered lighting across views and splits.
3. Evaluate dynamic ray regrouping only after profiling shows traversal
   divergence dominates; retain a simpler control implementation.
4. Before each pushed milestone: format, clippy with warnings denied, full
   workspace tests, physical-GPU parity, cgroup peak memory/events, and a
   committed benchmark manifest with artifact hashes.

Current result (2026-08-03): GPU timestamps isolate the training step, not path
recording or CPU work, as the bottleneck. At 2,048 pixels and 256 path slots, 28
scalar embedding-gradient scatters (density plus degree-2 RGB SH) spent about
80 ms per update atomically adding mostly zero padding. Meganeura `59f15ac`
skips exact-zero atomic sources, reducing that group to 5.1--6.5 ms and the
120-update GPU wait from 8.291 to 2.804 seconds. The full 1,200-update gate is
2.22x faster with stable quality. Ordinary gathers now lead the profile at
about 13 ms per update.

The follow-up coalesces the 27 individually named RGB/SH parameter tables only
inside the graph, preserving checkpoint and learning-rate semantics. One wide
gather/scatter replaces the scalar pairs: the graph falls from 391 to 348 GPU
passes and 24.5--25.5 to 11.6--11.7 ms per update. Full training is 1.84x
faster (29.51 to 16.00--16.05 seconds), with three quality repeats and a Bonsai
SH-2 fresh-PLY smoke inside the acceptance gate. Peak synthetic memory is
363.2 MB and the 3.37 GB full-workspace test scope records no memory events.
At the current production shape (200K cells, SH-3, 4,096 rays), the fair
current-Meganeura control falls from 506 to 421 timed passes and 62.34 to 26.62
ms per step (2.34x); cgroup peak falls 1.510 to 1.436 GB. The packed graph does
raise planned device-local memory from 495 to 962 MB. A per-channel layout
reduces that to 849 MB, but one of two full quality repeats develops the same
bad material/depth tail as a rejected traversal-cap arm, so RGB remains one
atomic dispatch. A future native packed-parameter representation should remove
the compatibility concat buffers before scaling far beyond 200K cells.

The selected path-mask cleanup then removes two redundant full-path
multiplications: the recorded interval is already masked, so padding has zero
raw optical depth, alpha, and weight. A physical-GPU regression proves exact
zero loss and parameter gradients even when padded weighted-path intervals and
Jacobians contain arbitrary nonzero values. The graph falls from 348 to 346
passes and ten profiled steps improve from a median 11.60 to 11.10 ms. Three
matched full runs improve median training time from 15.907 to 15.434 seconds
(3.1%), with overlapping held-pose, geometry, and held-light ranges. The full
workspace GPU test scope peaks at 3.08 GB and records no memory event.

Global path caps of 128 and 192 are rejected: 128 gives no meaningful speed
advantage over packing at 256 and loses the held-view tail, while 192 produces
6.80 world-unit training-depth RMSE and an unstable material fit. The next
reduction prototype replaces the SH ones-matmul with a generic packed
`SumInner`. Meganeura `66e1664` preserves scalar column order and is bit-exact
at the reduction output while lowering the synthetic step from 11.60--11.68 to
10.92--11.02 ms. Three complete runs train in 15.29--15.40 seconds, but one
still develops the known material/depth tail (material residual 0.1569), so
Blade remains on its previous Meganeura revision. The engine optimization is
published independently on `perf/packed-narrow-reduction`; it should be
uprevved only after the reconstruction gate is made robust to the atomic
position/topology instability. Other performance targets remain native
checkpoint-compatible packed parameters, dead input-gradient work, and compact
active path storage, still at the unchanged safe traversal extent.

A 32-neighbour fused-cloud covariance prior was also tested against the 66°
normal failure. A sign-aligned 50% blend reduces synthetic normal RMSE to
62.08° and raises unseen-light PSNR by 0.09 dB without losing coverage. It does
not transfer: the worst held-out view falls by 0.24 dB on Bonsai and 0.31 dB on
Room as Euclidean neighbourhoods cross thin surfaces and depth layers. The
implementation is removed. Normal updates need shared-view correspondence or
surface-aware neighbourhoods, not another local point-cloud smoother.

Balancing fused normals by observing view was also rejected. Equal view votes
over-correct for dense close views; square-root confidence weights preserve the
particle set and improve synthetic normal RMSE from 66.42° to 66.04°, but lose
0.01 dB mean and 0.07 dB on the worst Bonsai held-out view. Room is neutral to
slightly positive. Pixel-count heuristics therefore are not a reliable normal
objective either; the next experiment should improve the shared positions and
derive orientation from geometry that is consistent across views.

A direct photometric tangent-plane search was rejected as well. Two rings of
normal candidates repair a 25° error on an analytic textured plane, but rotate
4,723 of 5,445 scorable Bonsai particles by 24° on average and reduce held-out
PSNR from 14.50 to 14.42 dB (11.68 to 11.51 worst). Room falls from 14.37 to
14.34 dB. Normalized training-patch agreement therefore confounds orientation
with local depth layers and occlusion; normal/covariance work remains gated on
a shared surface objective with refreshed visibility.
